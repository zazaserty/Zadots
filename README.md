# Za.dots
My personal Gentoo setup is tailored to my preferences and incorporates a Dracula-inspired colorscheme that is easy on the eyes. To stay current and maintain a clean codebase, I have opted to use Wayland instead of Xorg. For the compositor, I have selected Hyprland for its simplicity and visually pleasing design, despite its slightly less minimalistic features compared to dwl or other options. In terms of the bar, I have found Waybar to be highly convenient and habitual. As for the notification manager, I highly recommend Dunst, due to its extensive customizability and seamless functionality.

Regarding authentication, I have found Doas to be an ideal option for a one-user system, as I do not require the full range of options offered by Sudo. Its smaller codebase is also a desirable factor.

Now, let us move on to the dependencies and other related details.

## Components and/or requirements
These config files will probably work on any distro, but gentoo is a personal recommendation for the tinkerers. It's a really simple and barebones setup.

- **Functional [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) setup, Gentoo steps [here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Wayland).**

- **[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) as the compositor.**

- **[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) as the status bar.**

- **[Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) as the notification daemon.**

- **[Swaybg](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg) to set the wallpaper.**

- **[Foot](https://github.com/r-c-f/foot) as the terminal emulator.**

- **[Wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) as the launcher.**

- **[Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) and [Pywalfox](https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox) to create a cohesive colorscheme between the terminal, browser and email client. To use Pywalfox on Librewolf follow [this](https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox/issues/68).**

- **[Pipewire](https://pipewire.org/) as the audio server, no Pulseaudio or Alsa.**

- **[Grim](https://sr.ht/~emersion/grim/), [Slurp](https://github.com/emersion/slurp) and [Swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy) combo for screenshots.**

- **[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) to sync my files to and from my selfhosted instance.**

- **[Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) to show some eye candy when the terminal starts up.**

- **[Cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), a relaxing utility to grow little trees in your terminal emulator.**

- **The [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) extension for Librewolf, and Firefox obviously, that allows to force a dark theme on all websites.**

## Credits

The realization of my customized setup is owed to the dedicated communities and developers who have contributed their time and expertise to the open-source movement. It is truly an honor to be a part of such a collaborative and supportive community where individuals assist one another in achieving their objectives. As such, I urge everyone to support and recognize the developers responsible for the dependencies I have utilized.

Furthermore, I feel it is crucial to acknowledge and appreciate the creators of the individual components utilized within my setup. It is thanks to their talent that I was able to construct the pieces of this "puzzle." While I have made minor modifications to some files, it is their original work that served as the foundation for my setup.
