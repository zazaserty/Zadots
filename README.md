# Za.dots
My personal, and by consequence opinionated, gentoo setup. It uses wayland instead of xorg, since it is more modern and cleaner on the codebase. I chose hyprland for the compositor, as it is simple to configure and pleasing by design even though it may not be as minimal as dwl or others. When it comes to the bar I use waybar because of convenience and out of habit, and I really recommend dunst as the notification manager since it's highly customizable and just works well.

But well, enough of my preferences, let's list dependencies and such.

# Dependencies and requirements
These config files will probably work on any distro, but gentoo is a personal recommendation for the tinkerers. It's a really simple and barebones setup.
