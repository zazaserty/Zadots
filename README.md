# Za.dots
My personal, and by consequence opinionated, gentoo rice that follows a dracula-ish colorscheme for ease on the eyes. It uses wayland instead of xorg, since it is more modern and cleaner on the codebase. I chose hyprland for the compositor, as it is simple to configure and pleasing by design even though it may not be as minimal as dwl or others. When it comes to the bar I use waybar because of convenience and out of habit, and I really recommend dunst as the notification manager since it's highly customizable and just works well. Last but not least, I like doas for authentication a lot since I do not need all the options that sudo offers for a one-user system and the codebase is smaller.

But well, enough of my preferences, let's list dependencies and such.

## Components and/or requirements
These config files will probably work on any distro, but gentoo is a personal recommendation for the tinkerers. It's a really simple and barebones setup.

**·Functional [wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) setup.**

**·[Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) as the compositor.**

**·[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) as the status bar.**

**·[Dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) as the notification daemon.**

**·[Swaybg](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg) to set the wallpaper.**

**·[Foot](https://github.com/r-c-f/foot) as the terminal emulator.**

**·[Wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) as the launcher.**

**·[Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) and [Pywalfox](https://github.com/Frewacom/pywalfox) to create a cohesive colorscheme for foot, browser and email client.**

**·[Pipewire](https://pipewire.org/) as the audio server, no pulseaudio or alsa.**

**·[Grim](https://sr.ht/~emersion/grim/), [Slurp](https://github.com/emersion/slurp) and [Swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy) combo for screenshots.**

**·[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) to sync my files to and from my selfhosted instance.**

**·[Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) to show some eye candy when the terminal starts up.**

**·[Cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), a relaxing utility to grow little trees in your terminal emulator.**

## Credits

Setups like these are made possible by the communities and developers behind these programs. It is an honor to be part of a movement like the opensource one where everyone helps each other out. Please support the developers behind the dependencies listed above.

It is also of utmost importance to acknowledge the creators of certain pieces used in this setup. Without them I would not have been able to put the pieces of this "puzzle" together. I modified some of the files a bit, but it is their work:
